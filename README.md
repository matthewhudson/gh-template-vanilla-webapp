# ðŸ“¦ VanillaJS WebApp Template

> No React, Vue, Angular, bundler, heavy configuration. Basically just HTML Boiierplate & Tachyons, with Parcel handling `watch` & `build` for JS & CSS.

> \*Typescript and Sass are _technically_ supported out of the box as well, but I have yet to try myself.

> This is for my one-offs tht nee some basic modern foundations, but are somewhere btween a a all JS/CSS in a single index.html, and somthinig lkie `create-react-app`.
